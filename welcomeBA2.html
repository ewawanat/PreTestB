<h1>Instructions Part 1.</h1>
<h2>In Part 1  you are asked to listen to some sentences and you will see these sentences on the screen. The written version of the sentences will have gaps in them. We ask you to fill out those gaps by typing in the missing words that you heard in each sentence. </h2>
<h2>There can be more than one word per field. You will hear each sentence only one time, so please try to listen carefully and prepare for listening before you click the Play button. </h2>
<h2>If you can't understand these words, just type in your best guess and move on to the next one by clicking the &lsquo;next&rsquo; button.</h2>
<h2>You will first get a short practice at this. Click 'next &gt;' to start.</h2>
